# That one Flying Bear Wiki you've been looking for
This repo is created with the sole purpose of becoming your one-stop wiki if you got yourself one of Flying Bear printers.
I , the OG Cheatos, will give this repo at least an hour of work a week, trying to shape it into a proper wiki worthy of your attention.
Needless to say this is a work in progress.

## General Information
At this point the only entries we have are for Flying Bear Ghost 5, fill free to expand this list :)

### Hardware

My copy of this printer is based on the following hardware:

- Main board: MKS Robin Nano v1.2 with STM32F103VE6
- Stepper motor drivers: 2xTCM2208 v2.0(X + Y), 2xA4988 (Z + extruder)
- Stepper motors:
  - X: 42HY40-1.8-31.5B
  - Y: 42HY47-2-24
  - Z: 42HY47-2-12
  - E0: 42HY40-1.8-31.5B

Here is how the mainboard looked right after the purchase:
